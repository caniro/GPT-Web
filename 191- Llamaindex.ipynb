All they really mean is that their interest in you\\nis a function of other investors\\' interest in you.  I.e. the spectral\\nsignature of all mediocre investors.  But when phrased in terms of\\nleads, it sounds like there is something structural and therefore\\nlegitimate about their behavior.<br /><br />When an investor tells you \"I want to invest in you, but I don\\'t\\nlead,\" translate that in your mind to \"No, except yes if you turn\\nout to be a hot deal.\"  And since that\\'s the default opinion of any\\ninvestor about any startup, they\\'ve essentially just told you\\nnothing.<br /><br />When you first start fundraising, the expected value of an investor\\nwho won\\'t \"lead\" is zero, so talk to such investors last if at all.<br /><br />\\n<b>Have multiple plans.</b><br /><br />Many investors will ask how much you\\'re planning to raise. This\\nquestion makes founders feel they should be planning to raise a\\nspecific amount.  But in fact you shouldn\\'t.  It\\'s a mistake to\\nhave fixed plans in an undertaking as unpredictable as fundraising.<br /><br />So why do investors ask how much you plan to raise?  For much the\\nsame reasons a salesperson in a store will ask \"How much were you\\nplanning to spend?\" if you walk in looking for a gift for a friend.\\nYou probably didn\\'t have a precise amount in mind; you just want\\nto find something good, and if it\\'s inexpensive, so much the better.\\nThe salesperson asks you this not because you\\'re supposed to have\\na plan to spend a specific amount, but so they can show you only\\nthings that cost the most you\\'ll pay.<br /><br />Similarly, when investors ask how much you plan to raise, it\\'s not\\nbecause you\\'re supposed to have a plan.  It\\'s to see whether you\\'d\\nbe a suitable recipient for the size of investment they like to\\nmake, and also to judge your ambition, reasonableness, and how far\\nyou are along with fundraising.<br /><br />If you\\'re a wizard at fundraising, you can say \"We plan to raise\\na $7 million series A round, and we\\'ll be accepting termsheets next\\ntuesday.\"  I\\'ve known a handful of founders who could pull that off\\nwithout having VCs laugh in their faces.  But if you\\'re in the\\ninexperienced but earnest majority, the solution is analogous to\\nthe solution I recommend for <a href=\"convince.html\">pitching</a>\\nyour startup: do the right thing and then just tell investors what\\nyou\\'re doing.<br /><br />And the right strategy, in fundraising, is to have multiple plans\\ndepending on how much you can raise.  Ideally you should be able\\nto tell investors something like: we can make it to profitability\\nwithout raising any more money, but if we raise a few hundred\\nthousand we can hire one or two smart friends, and if we raise a\\ncouple million, we can hire a whole engineering team, etc.<br /><br />Different plans match different investors.  If you\\'re talking to a\\nVC firm that only does series A rounds (though there are few of\\nthose left), it would be a waste of time talking about any but your\\nmost expensive plan.  Whereas if you\\'re talking to an angel who\\ninvests $20k at a time and you haven\\'t raised any money yet, you\\nprobably want to focus on your least expensive plan.<br /><br />If you\\'re so fortunate as to have to think about the upper limit\\non what you should raise, a good rule of thumb is to multiply the\\nnumber of people you want to hire times $15k times 18 months.  In\\nmost startups, nearly all the costs are a function of the number\\nof people, and $15k per month is the conventional total cost\\n(including benefits and even office space) per person.  $15k per\\nmonth is high, so don\\'t actually spend that much.  But it\\'s ok to\\nuse a high estimate when fundraising to add a margin for error.  If\\nyou have additional expenses, like manufacturing, add in those at\\nthe end.  Assuming you have none and you think you might hire 20\\npeople, the most you\\'d want to raise is 20 x $15k x 18 = $5.4\\nmillion.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=22303, end_char_idx=26406, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.8239322544181872)], metadata={'fe2503a0-a841-494d-901d-35b7c800caaf': {'url': 'http://www.paulgraham.com/fr.html'}, 'ac3ab3ea-d477-47a7-ab30-09bad754d4a7': {'url': 'http://www.paulgraham.com/fr.html'}})"
